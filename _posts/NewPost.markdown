Vinicius is a Brazilian name and a pretty popular one. Famous examples include Vinicius de Moraes, the composer of Girl from Ipanema, and Vini Jr, the best footballer in the world.

Kumagai is my family's name, it's from Japan and it means Bear Valley.

I also have a middle name: Kenji. It is a common name in Japan. Its meaning depends on which kanji you use. Since my father didn't really think about it, it could really meaning anything.
